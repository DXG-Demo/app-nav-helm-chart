# This yaml file contains options to ignore or reduce the severity specific cv 
# lint messages using regular expression to match on message text.  
#
# Ignored message: '\[ERROR\] Parameter is defined but never used in a template.*'
# Reason: WebSphere Liberty Helm Chart uses Shared Liberty Templates (SLT), which uses  
#         the defined parameters, so this message can be safely ignored.
#
# Ignored message: '\[ERROR\] Missing recommended metering labels.*'
# Reason: WebSphere Liberty Helm Chart uses Shared Liberty Templates (SLT) to get common templats, and 
#         SLT already has those metering annotations, so this message can be safely ignored.
#
# Ignored message: '\[WARNING\] Description is too long.*'
# Reason: The long description is needed to give users meaningful information. Verified that even 
#         the longest meesage we have is rendered correctly by UI. So this message can be safely ignored.
#
# Reduced Error to Warning: '\[ERROR\] Missing livenessProbe: livenessProbe not found.*'
# Reason: We added livenessProbe but then it resulted in weird behaviours, so reversed changes (https://github.ibm.com/WASCloudPrivate/roadmap/issues/413). 
#         Liberty server itself may not have the mechanism to check liveness. So this may require major design and canâ€™t be done at this point. 
#         There are few workitems already opened for this: https://github.ibm.com/WASCloudPrivate/roadmap/issues/421 
#                                                          https://github.ibm.com/WASCloudPrivate/roadmap/issues/328
